Israel is committing genocide of the Palestinian people.

The population in Gaza is facing starvation, displacement and
annihilation amid relentless bombardment and suffocating restrictions
on life-saving humanitarian aid.

As of March 2025, Israel has killed over 50,000 Palestinians in the
Gaza Strip – including 15,600 children – targeting homes, hospitals,
schools, and refugee camps.  However, the true death toll in Gaza may
be at least around 41% higher than official records suggest.

The website <https://databasesforpalestine.org/> records extensive
digital evidence of Israel's genocidal acts against Palestinians.
Save it to your bookmarks and let more people know about it.

Silence is complicity.
Protest and boycott the genocidal apartheid state of Israel.


                 From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.
